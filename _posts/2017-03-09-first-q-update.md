**With 2017 well underway, we are pleased to report great progress on all the Nous Entertainment projects.**


Our flagship production, **_Abide _**(formerly _Proud Mary_) is moving forward with the uber-talented directorial team, Coodie Simmons and Chike Ozah, (_Coodie_ _and_ _Chike_). We are now eagerly anticipating filming. Coodie and Chike are an award-winning duo whose groundbreaking work was featured on ESPN, MTV and at the American Black Film Festival. On Feb. 16, their latest project, _The First to Do It_ – a documentary on the life of Early Lloyd, the first African American to play in the NBA – premiered at the NBA All-Star Weekend. They worked with executive producers including Carmelo Anthony and Tony Parker on this important piece.
 
Staci R. Collins Jackson has also joined**_ Abide_** as producer to bring decades of experience in entertainment and communicates to our team. One of the most accomplished communications strategists in the entertainment business, her clients include: Charles D. King (Executive Producer of the multi-award-winning _Fences_), Jesse Collins (Executive Producer of ratings juggernaut _The New Edition Story_), and Hollywood director Tim Story (highest grossing African American director in the world). She is the publicist for _Mudbound_, which opened at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival to high critical-acclaim and resulted in the highest sale at the 2017 festival.  Her previous roles include Director of Communications at Harpo Studios and publicist for Oprah Winfrey.

We continue to develop and focus on **_Judas Horse_** and **_Griffin’s Ghost_** working closely with Eduardo Sanchez (noted for the _Blair Witch Project_) who will direct both of these thrilling and fast-paced films.


Most recently, we welcomed a new project, **_The Night Swimmer, _**to our roster and are thrilled to share details in the forthcoming weeks. The work of award-winning writer, director and editor, Laurie Weltz, this screenplay explores the evolution of a young man who adopts the identities of others to more deeply connect to his deceased family. Laurie’s previous work including _About Scout_ and _Wrestling with Alligators_ were released theatrically and have received critical acclaim.
