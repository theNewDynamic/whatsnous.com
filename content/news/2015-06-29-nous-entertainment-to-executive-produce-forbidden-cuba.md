**FAR HILLS, NJ – June 29, 2015** – Nous Entertainment LLC today announced that co-founders Adam Scherr and Suzan Binder will serve as Executive Producers of the feature film, *Forbidden Cuba*. Produced by Great Jones Productions and created by noted independent filmmaker Art Jones, *Forbidden Cuba* tells the story of the island nation and one lost American on the verge of revolutionary change.

The film was shot on location in Cuba by Jones and his team of four without studio backing or official permits. The dramatic comedy, which Deadline.com applauded as “gripping,” recently reached its crowd-funding goal to complete post-production.

“We are honored by the attention and support the film has received from Peter Bart and the Tribeca Film Festival,” said Art Jones. “Our team is thrilled to partner with Nous to help bring us over our Kickstarter finish line and support us through the post-production phase.”

*Forbidden Cuba* is the story of an American businessman who discovers the immense natural and cultural beauty of Cuba while on a journey to find a missing colleague. In time, the protagonist becomes increasingly lost and begins to question his assumptions about Cuba and the shape of its new relationship with the United States. As Jones noted, “The film and the awareness we can generate around it will help build needed connections between the people of Cuba and the U.S. who have been kept apart for over 50 years.”

“Our decision to invest in *Forbidden Cuba* was instantaneous – the entrepreneurial and adventurous spirit behind the concept completely aligns with our approach to create entertaining and insightful content,” said Adam Scherr, Co-Founder, Nous Entertainment. “We applaud Art Jones and his team for their daring trek and their ability to capture the unique culture of Cuba.”

Nous Entertainment expects *Forbidden Cuba* to be available to public audiences at international film festivals in the fall of 2015 and winter of 2016. To learn more about the film and the filming process, visit Deadline or Tribeca Film.
