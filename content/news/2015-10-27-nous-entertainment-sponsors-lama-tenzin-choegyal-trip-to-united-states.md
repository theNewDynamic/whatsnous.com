**NOUS ENTERTAINMENT SPONSORS LAMA TENZIN CHOEGYAL TRIP TO UNITED STATES** _Hosts Noted Humanitarian During Visit to New York, New Jersey_

**FAR HILLS, NJ – Oct. 27, 2015** – [Nous Entertainment LLC](http://www.whatsnous.com) announced that it is hosting the Venerable Lama Tenzin Choegyal, a noted humanitarian and Buddhist monk, during his Oct. 2015 visit to the United States. Nous will accompany Lama Tenzin on a tour of meetings within the business, academic and spiritual communities across New York City and New Jersey as part of the company's mission to increase awareness of human issues across the world.

"Bringing Lama Tenzin to this part of our country means that we can help amplify his voice and bring awareness to the causes he so deeply supports," said Suzan Binder, Co-Founder, Nous Entertainment. "The children he helps to care for are deeply vulnerable to disease, neglect and mistreatment and Lama Tenzin's work is life-changing for them."

Since 2000, Lama Tenzin has committed himself to improving the lives of children in India and Tibet. In the early 2000s, he established the Children's Educational Development (CED) Society in Northern India. A privately run home and school where children from the deeply impoverished, remote Dolpo region of the Himalaya Mountains have the opportunity to thrive in a safe and nurturing environment. His most recent initiative is G.I.F.T. (Girls Institute for Technology) to empower girls living with disabilities in Dehradun, India.
