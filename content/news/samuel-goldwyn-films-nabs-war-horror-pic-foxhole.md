Samuel Goldwyn Films has acquired the North American rights to Jack Fessenden’s war film _Foxhole_ after a [world premiere at](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/foxhole-oldenburg-2021-1235013824/) Oldenberg.

The drama — which stars Motell Gyn Foster, Alex Hurt and Cody Kostro — over a span of 36 hours captures Americans in three separate wars — the U.S. Civil War, World War I and the Iraq war. _Foxhole_ follows a small group of soldiers trapped in a confined space as they grapple with morality, futility and volatile combat.
