**NEW YORK, May 31, 2016** /PRNewswire/ – Nous Entertainment LLC is pleased to announce that Eduardo Sanchez will direct its film project "Griffin's Ghost." Sanchez is noted for writing, editing and directing "The Blair Witch Project."

"Griffin's Ghost" is a suspenseful mystery around the convergence of a young family's new life and the thrilling, deep-rooted secrets of their home's former owners. The story is set in a dilapidated home being renovated by Griffin and John Kidder – a New York couple whose anticipation of parenthood and a quiet suburban life is upended by the scarred presence of ghostly apparitions. As the film unfolds, Griffin befriends a young spirit to unravel the deception surrounding the death of his family and to relieve the pain of floating between worlds.

"'Griffin's Ghost' explores unexpected territory for this genre. It's a significant departure from what we know as a traditional ghost tale," said Eduardo Sanchez, Director. "I'm thrilled to direct 'Griffin's Ghost' and looking into a multi-picture commitment with Nous."

The film is derived from a screenplay written by Pulitzer-nominated playwright Jack Zeman. Zeman (1945-2008) is known for his debut work, Past Tense, a drama featured on-stage in theaters across the world. Notable actors including Paul Newman and Ellen Burstyn have starred in various theatrical productions. "Griffin's Ghost" was one of the playwright's last works.

"Not only was Jack an extraordinary writer, he was an important father figure to me and I'm honored that Eduardo is bringing his talents to this film and Jack's vision," said Adam Scherr, co-founder, Nous Entertainment. "Eduardo and I share a mutual passion for narratives that explore well-known concepts in unusual ways. 'Griffin's Ghost' will appeal to the thrill-seeker, mystery lovers and fans of complex, humanity-driven stories."
