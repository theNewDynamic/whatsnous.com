NEW YORK, March 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- [Nous Entertainment LLC](http://www.whatsnous.com/proud-mary/) today announced that it is in pre-production on its flagship film, "Proud Mary." The biographical saga, which chronicles a Baltimore family over seven decades, will align with local, Baltimore resources throughout the film's development and release to support the Baltimore community. Most immediately, the company is pleased to announce Rafael Alvarez – noted Baltimore native, writer and producer – as co-writer on the screenplay as well as a partnership with impactful non-profit, Living Classrooms.

"Proud Mary" is the true story of Mary Sharpe, a young, black, Christian orphan from Indiana and her eventual rise to becoming the Yiddish-speaking matriarch of a large Jewish family in 20th-century Baltimore. With the significant topics of race and abuse and the themes of redemption and hope at the core of the film, the story illustrates the cultural and social dynamics of 20th century Baltimore and its multi-cultural families.

"Mary's story is infinitely strengthened by aligning with Baltimore institutions and natives who understand the unique history of – and opportunity for – Baltimore residents," said Nous Founder, "Proud Mary" writer and Baltimore-native, Adam Scherr. "We are honored that Mr. Alvarez will bring his expertise and authentic voice to the script and the story. Baltimore is a storied, complex city and it's critical that our portrayal of this time and place is both genuine and uplifting."

Alvarez is an author, writer and producer born and raised in Baltimore. His notable work includes the HBO Drama, "The Wire" as well as several bylines in _the Baltimore Sun._ He also authored the Baltimore-centric anthology of short stories, _The Fountain of Highlandtown_.

In addition to including local voices into the script, Nous is committed to casting locally born talent and filming on-location. The company has also selected Baltimore-based Living Classrooms as a philanthropic partner and will announce further details in Q2 2016.
