![](/uploads/brooklyn_all_american_poster.jpg)Our story is unique and compelling with a broad demographic appeal. We start in Brooklyn, travel to Louisiana, and reach our conclusion back in Brooklyn. Our protagonist, ***Moishe Katzov***, succeeds in finding his true self against all odds. It’s a culture-clash comedy of errors that has him being pushed and pulled in unimaginable directions.

Our narrative is noble, graceful, raunchy at times, and above all, a spirited comedy- drama featuring Jews from Brooklyn, Louisiana Cajuns, Goth girls, Sorority vamps, unkosher foods and a key ingredient—football!
