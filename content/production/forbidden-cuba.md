> “A timely feature to seek out … Forbidden Cuba is very timely, exploring the potential for U.S. exploitation of Cuba now that the borders have opened. Finishing it involved multiple hidden cameras, shooting without permits, and the filmmakers' undergoing hours of scrutiny from government figures, but none of that treacherousness is felt here. It's an unexpectedly gentle, easygoing film, like Local Hero and a version of Martin Sheen's search for Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. Given the guerrilla filmmaking behind it, we would forgive Forbidden Cuba for looking shoddy, but it doesn't. The movie is a beautifully lit and -staged road odyssey, and Cuba's beaches and countryside are as intoxicating to the audience as they are to Gil, the main character. It ends up endorsing Cuba as a place to offer a second chance at grace.”

> "I want to focus on filmmaking as an adventure; specifically to tip my hat to Art Jones, a filmmaker who went off the grid to film a gripping 'dramady' called FORBIDDEN CUBA. Eager to tell the truth about this fast-changing island, Jones and his small French-American team flew to Cuba without permits or studio advances and managed to shoot for a month without getting deported or arrested. There’s a great story to be told."
