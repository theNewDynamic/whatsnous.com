In this tension-packed psychological thriller, protagonist, Griffin Kidder is a career New Yorker with a strong yearning to be a mother. Ready to start a peaceful life outside the city, Griffin and her construction-savvy husband purchase a dilapidated house to renovate, only to discover the suburban home already has residents: a scarred family of apparitions. After relentless torment by the youngest of the spirits, Griffin finally confronts the ghost. Only when their unusual connection deepens, does she realize the true threat isn’t inside the house. To expose the deception behind the deaths, the Kidders create unlikely alliances with a deeply traumatized family seeking release of their earth-bound pain.
