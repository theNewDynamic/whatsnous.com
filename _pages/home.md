## Through strategic partnerships within the entertainment industry, private equity and venture capital firms, and leading philanthropic organizations, we are committed to providing innovators and artists with channels to communicate their impactful and extraordinary stories.

### Our Story                      

Our name celebrates the themes represented by the ancient term, Nous: the faculty of the human mind; intellectual understanding of what is true and real; and the concepts of thought and reason.  

We are storytellers who celebrate the strength and depth of the human intellect and its ability to create joy as well as enact change. We use film–including theatrical, feature-length, digital and television formats – as our vehicle for distributing inspiring narratives and entertaining stories.
